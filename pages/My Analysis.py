The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assess the risk of an individual developing coronary heart disease (CHD) within the next 10 years. To achieve this, we will:

1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
2. Address **missing data** using appropriate techniques.
3. Develop a **machine learning model** for heart disease prediction.
4. Assess and visualize the performance of the model.

Understanding missing values is crucial in data analysis as they can affect the performance of models and the overall insights we derive from the data.

After analyzing the missing values in the dataset, I have decided to drop rows with missing data. Since this is medical data, many of the features are categorical, 
and filling missing values with averages (mean or median) would not provide meaningful or accurate results. 
For example, filling in someone's medical measurements, like cholesterol or glucose levels, based on average values could lead to inaccurate insights or predictions. 
Therefore, removing the missing data will maintain the integrity and reliability of the analysis.

In this section, we analyze the dataset and ensure that the variable types are appropriate for the predictive modeling process.

We have identified several variables in our dataset that should be treated as categorical. These include:

- **Sex_male**: Indicates whether the individual is male (1) or not (0).
- **currentSmoker**: Indicates whether the individual is a current smoker (1) or not (0).
- **BPMeds**: Indicates whether the individual is on blood pressure medication (1) or not (0).
- **prevalentStroke**: Indicates whether the individual has a history of stroke (1) or not (0).
- **prevalentHyp**: Indicates whether the individual has hypertension (1) or not (0).
- **diabetes**: Indicates whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).
- **TenYearCHD**: Indicates whether the individual is predicted to have coronary heart disease in the next 10 years (1) or not (0).

To optimize our analysis, these variables have been converted to categorical data types. This allows us to effectively utilize them in our machine learning models, as categorical variables can be better handled during model training and evaluation.

The histograms above provide valuable insights into the distribution of numeric variables in our heart disease dataset:

1. **Age**: The age distribution appears to be roughly normal, with a peak around 60 years, indicating that this is the age range where heart disease prevalence may be higher.

2. **Education**: The education variable shows a distinct bar distribution, suggesting that most individuals have achieved either low or moderate levels of education, which could impact health outcomes.

3. **Cigarettes Per Day**: The distribution of cigarettes smoked per day indicates a significant number of individuals who are non-smokers, with a few outliers who smoke heavily, highlighting the importance of smoking as a risk factor.

4. **Total Cholesterol**: The total cholesterol levels show a right-skewed distribution, with most individuals having levels below 300, but with a few cases exceeding this threshold, indicating potential health risks.

5. **Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure**: Both blood pressure measures exhibit a normal distribution, but with noticeable peaks at lower values, suggesting a trend towards healthier blood pressure levels among the majority.

6. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: The BMI distribution is left-skewed, with a concentration of individuals falling below the average range of 25, which may indicate a healthier population in terms of weight.

7. **Heart Rate**: The histogram of heart rate displays a more uniform distribution, suggesting a diverse range of heart rates among individuals, which may correlate with varying fitness levels.

8. **Glucose Levels**: Glucose levels are highly right-skewed, with most individuals showing low levels and a few outliers with elevated glucose levels, indicating potential health concerns such as prediabetes or diabetes.

Overall, these distributions provide important context for understanding the demographic and health-related characteristics of the individuals in this dataset. They can inform our modeling decisions and highlight potential areas for further investigation in relation to heart disease risk factors.

2. **At Risk**: A smaller proportion of individuals are classified as 'at risk,' highlighting the importance of targeted interventions for this group. Understanding the characteristics of these individuals can help identify risk factors and develop strategies to mitigate heart disease risk.

Overall, this class distribution provides essential context for modeling and analysis, emphasizing the need to address the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease in the at-risk population.
