# Goal of the analysis section
st.header("Goal of the Analysis")
st.markdown("""
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assess the risk of an individual developing coronary heart disease (CHD) within the next 10 years. To achieve this, we will:

1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
2. Address **missing data** using appropriate techniques.
3. Develop a **machine learning model** for heart disease prediction.
4. Assess and visualize the performance of the model.
